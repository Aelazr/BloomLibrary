BloomLibrary
============

Bloom Library is a single page application built with AngularJS, currently with a Parse.com backend. It will allow users to updload Bloom shell books to share with others, and find shells to download and use.


Dependencies
=============

* AngularJS
* [Restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular)
* [Router-UI](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)
* Angular-UI
* FancyBox
* Bootstrap
* Underscore
* Lodash
* JQuery
* JQuery-UI

Where possible, use [bower](http://bower.io) to add dependencies, e.g.

Be careful about versions... angularjs and many of these related projects we're using are all changing constantly, and updating one of them may break it all.
