BloomLibrary
============

Bloom Library is a single page application built with AngularJS, currently with a Parse.com backend. It will allow users to updload Bloom shell books to share with others, and find shells to download and use.


Dependencies
=============

You can see [current dependencies here](https://github.com/BloomBooks/BloomLibrary/blob/master/src/BloomLibrary_AngularApp/bower.json).

After cloning, go to src\BloomLibrary_AngularApp and do

    bower install
    
Where possible, use [bower](http://bower.io) to add dependencies, e.g. (cd to the directory that has bower.json, currently src\BloomLibrary_AngularApp and)

    bower install --save the-package-name

Be careful about versions... angularjs and many of these related projects we're using are all changing constantly, and updating one of them may break it all.
