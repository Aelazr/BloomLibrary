            We try to keep your email secret from spammers, but we can't promise. Pretty much everything you contribute
            is visible to the public, including enough of your email so that it's probably possible to identify
            who you are if you contribute a book.

            not limited to your IP address, URL request, browser type, and date and time of your request.

            The Bloom Library requests personally identifiable information when you register for an account.
            Information may be used or requested to perform research, improve usability of the site,
            administer mailing lists or online communities, or other activities related to the Bloom Library services.

        <div class="termsItem">
            In particular the information provided about each book includes part of the email address you gave us when you signed up.
            We try to hide enough of the address so that it cannot be easily used by spammers, but it may well include
            enough personal information to allow someone to determine the identity of the person who contributed a particular
            book. Please do not contribute books if you do not wish others to discover that you did so.
        </div>
        <div class="termsItem">
            We may be required by law (including a court order) to disclose the information you submit.

            The developers of this site are attempting to take reasonable precautions to make it difficult for malicious users to obtain your full email address,
            but we cannot promise that we will be successful; and if you upload a book we provide a deliberate mechanism for users to contact you,
            which will give them access to the email address you gave us. You should assume that with sufficient determination
            someone can probably get access to anything you contribute to this site.
