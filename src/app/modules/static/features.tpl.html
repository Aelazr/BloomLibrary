                <h3>Template Books</h3>
                <p>Bloom isn't just for <em>shell</em> books. To create a brand new book, we use what Bloom calls a <em>template</em>. For most books, the "Basic Book" template is enough. It contains templates pages with the most frequently used layouts. There is also a Picture Dictionary template and Wall Calendar template.</p>
